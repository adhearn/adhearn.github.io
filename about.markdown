Hi there, I'm Alex! By day, I'm a data engineer; by night (and sometimes early morning) I'm a programming language enthusiast. These days, I mostly program in Python, but all the most beautiful programs I've ever seen have been in Scheme, which remains near and dear to my heart. I get most excited about elegant ways to efficiently represent powerful programming abstractions. Right now, my major personal project is Plachutta, which is both a language and an interpreter for that language, and I suspect most of my writing for the foreseeable future will be focused on what I learn as I develop Plachutta further. Stay tuned for more!
